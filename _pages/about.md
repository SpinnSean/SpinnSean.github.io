I'm a graduate student in machine learning at Mila, under the supervision of [Irina Rish](https://sites.google.com/site/irinarish/) and [Patricia Conrod](https://www.conrodventurelab.com/). My research is mainly focused on reinforcement learning in human decision making, brain development, and neuro-inspired AI.
